	<div class="definition" align="center">"A pleasant smell that frequently accompanies the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather. The word is constructed from Greek, <i>petra</i>, meaning ‘stone’, + <i>ichor</i>, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.<br><br><br>The term was coined in 1964 by two researchers, Isabel Joy Bear and Roderick G. Thomas, for an article in the journal <i>Nature</i>. In the article, the authors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay-based soils and rocks. During rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound, geosmin, a metabolic by-product of certain Actinobacteria, which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive scent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning. In a follow-up paper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil retards seed germination and early plant growth. This would indicate that the plants exude the oil in order to safeguard the seeds from germination under duress."</div>
